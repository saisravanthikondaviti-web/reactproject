💀 LEVEL 5 — “The Impossible Button”
🧠 Concept: The Button You Can’t Click

Screen says:

“Click the button to escape.”

There is one button:
🚪 ESCAPE

BUT…

When the user tries to move their mouse over it…

👉 The button moves away.
👉 It teleports randomly.
👉 It dodges the cursor.

It feels impossible.

😏 The Twist

The button can ONLY be clicked if:

👉 The player presses and holds the Shift key
THEN clicks it.

If they try normal clicking → it runs away forever.

This is clever, funny, and very portfolio-level.
